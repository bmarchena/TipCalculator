This application will allow a user to enter a bill amount in dollars. The user will then use a seekbar to
indicate what percentage of tip will be applied. The tip and total will then be calculated and displayed. The
user then has the option to indicate how many people will be splitting the bill, up to a maximum number of four. 
They also have the choice to round the tip or total to the nearest dollar. 

The application also contains an options menu with Info and Share icons. Tapping the Info icon will bring up an App 
Info dialog explaining how to use the TipCalculator. Tapping the Share icon will the allow user to send an SMS 
message to contacts containing the bill amount, tip, total, and the amount owed per person.
